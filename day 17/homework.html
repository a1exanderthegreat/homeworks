<h1>From My Experience Goal-Oriented-Academy is the best academy, where you can learn different programing languages besides in GOA we are close to each other, help each other also crew leaders are very friendly and lessons are also very fun its not like school where you are sitting in class for 40-45 min and just sleeping or doing some shi- well its just better if u want to meet new guys who can help u in the future and learn programing you have to join GOA trust me you wont regret it :33
